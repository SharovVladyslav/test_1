Weil der Meister uns gesandt
Verk√ºnden wir den Untergang
Der Reiter der Boshaftigkeit

HERE I`VE ADDED A FIRST FITURE
Added second feature

Went to main
Went wrong

THE STORM CAME

Twenty ships with Norsemen braves
Riding the northern wind

They left their shores at early dawn
As a red sun was rising in the east
